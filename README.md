# Automated-Fracture-Detection
Bone fractures are a widespread health issue affecting millions of people globally. To enable quick and automated categorization of fractures, this project aims to develop a machine learning model trained on a dataset of annotated fractured and non-fractured images. 

Problem Statement
Bone Fractures are a common medical issue, and accurate identification of fractures plays a vital role in patient care. However, the manual interpretation of X-ray images by doctors can be subjective and prone to human error, leading to potential missed diagnoses or delays in treatment. Therefore, there is a pressing need to develop an automated fracture detection system that can assist doctors in accurately identifying fractures and minimize the risk of misdiagnosis. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and trained models, this system aims to provide a reliable and efficient mechanism to enhance the detection and categorization of fractures in X-ray images. By automating this process, healthcare professionals can benefit from increased accuracy, reduced diagnostic errors, and improved patient care.
